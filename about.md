My name is Gordon Sulc. I am a software engineer at Hamilton Storage, where I design robotic control software. I'm interested in clean code and architecture. In my free time, I enjoy racing motorcycles, backpacking, hiking, travel, and photography.

## Projects

### NConfig
[NConfig](https://github.com/gsulc/NConfig) was born out of frustration with appalling and horrific configuration code I witnessed and a lack of simplicity and flexibility in the .NET API for configuration. Microsoft's tools were XML-based; yuck! The idea was simple: just deserialize the file right into objects, then I could use those objects in my application. If it was necessary to switch to another tool, like a database, it would be easy to conform to the same interface.

### NModbus.UI
[NModbus.UI](https://github.com/gsulc/NModbus.UI) is a user interface for reading/writing Modbus objects. Only Modbus master functionality is implemented at the moment.
